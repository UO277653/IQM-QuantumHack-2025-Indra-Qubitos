The coupling between the qubit and the resonator can be described with the [Jaynes-Cummings model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jaynes%E2%80%93Cummings_model), which allows for two different regimes of the system, the **resonant** and the **dispersive** one. In the latter, looking at the spectrum of the resonator, one can infer the state of the qubit thanks to the **shift** in the resonator's frequency caused by the coupling.\n","\n","The raw measurement signal is typically represented as a **complex number** as function of time. The measurement instrument integrates the signal over time to yield a complex number, one per measurement operation.\n","\n","What we are used to see as a result of a measurement looks different though, right? An extra step is required: the complex number is rotated so that the difference between the states is maximal along the real axis. The real value of the signal is then compared with a **calibrated threshold value**, from which we get the well known 0/1 labels :)\n","\n","In the following, **we will not perform the thresholding** to investigate and get familiar with the raw results of a measurement operation!"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"cbe80676","metadata":{"id":"cbe80676"},"source":["### 2.1 Measuring a qubit in different states\n","\n","Knowing now that the readout signal depends on the state of the qubit, our strategy will be to prepare the qubits in different states and compare observations!\n","We will inspect the results of 3 circuits:\n","1.
